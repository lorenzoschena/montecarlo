Installation
============

You can install the package using ``pip`` and a locally cloned repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/lorenzoschena/montecarlo.git
    cd montecarlo
    pip install -e .

The ``-e`` flag enables an *editable install*, which is useful during development. 

Otherwise, you can install from TestPyPI (previous years):

.. code-block:: bash 
    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ tscvki-montecarlo
