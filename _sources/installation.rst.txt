Installation
============

You can install the package using ``pip`` and a locally cloned repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/lorenzoschena/montecarlo.git
    cd montecarlo
    pip install -e .

The ``-e`` flag enables an *editable install*, which is useful during development.
